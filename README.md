# Bookyst
Bookyst is a social cataloging web application that allows 
users to recommend books to the community of readers. 
They can create 'shelves' and post books they have read. 
They can access othersâ€™ recommendation and read plot summaries
before choosing to read them. Implemented here in Node.js, 
MongoDB, Express, Mongoose, Pug, and CSS.
It's hosted on Heroku.
